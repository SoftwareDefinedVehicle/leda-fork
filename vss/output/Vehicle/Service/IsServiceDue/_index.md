## Eclipse Leda: Usage Example

In [Eclipse Kuksa.VAL Databroker](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val/tree/master/kuksa_databroker) CLI:



```bash
$ databroker-cli
sdv.databroker.v1 > connect
[connect] OK
sdv.databroker.v1 > get Vehicle.Service.IsServiceDue
[get]  OK
Vehicle.Service.IsServiceDue: ( NotAvailable )
sdv.databroker.v1 > set Vehicle.Service.IsServiceDue false
[set]  OK
```

## About VSS

The [Vehicle Signal Specification](https://covesa.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/) (VSS)
is an initiative by COVESA to define a syntax and a catalog for vehicle signals.
The source code and releases can be found in the [VSS github repository](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification).

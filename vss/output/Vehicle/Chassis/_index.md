## Signal Information




The vehicle signal `Vehicle.Chassis` is a **Branch**.





## UUID

Each vehicle signal is identified by a [Universally Unique Identifier (UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier))

The UUID for `Vehicle.Chassis` is `87d260d635425da0a4ebd62bc4e5c313`

## Children

This vehicle signal is a branch or structure and thus has sub-pages:

- [Vehicle.Chassis.Accelerator](accelerator/) (Accelerator signals)
- [Vehicle.Chassis.Axle](axle/) (Axle signals)
- [Vehicle.Chassis.AxleCount](axlecount/) (Number of axles on the vehicle)
- [Vehicle.Chassis.Brake](brake/) (Brake system signals)
- [Vehicle.Chassis.ParkingBrake](parkingbrake/) (Parking brake signals)
- [Vehicle.Chassis.SteeringWheel](steeringwheel/) (Steering wheel signals)
- [Vehicle.Chassis.Track](track/) (Overall wheel tracking, in mm.)
- [Vehicle.Chassis.Wheelbase](wheelbase/) (Overall wheel base, in mm.)

## About VSS

The [Vehicle Signal Specification](https://covesa.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/) (VSS)
is an initiative by COVESA to define a syntax and a catalog for vehicle signals.
The source code and releases can be found in the [VSS github repository](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification).

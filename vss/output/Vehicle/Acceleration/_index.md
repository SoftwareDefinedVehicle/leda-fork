## Signal Information




The vehicle signal `Vehicle.Acceleration` is a **Branch**.





## UUID

Each vehicle signal is identified by a [Universally Unique Identifier (UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier))

The UUID for `Vehicle.Acceleration` is `6c490e6a798c5abc8f0178ed6deae0a8`

## Children

This vehicle signal is a branch or structure and thus has sub-pages:

- [Vehicle.Acceleration.Lateral](lateral/) (Vehicle acceleration in Y (lateral acceleration).)
- [Vehicle.Acceleration.Longitudinal](longitudinal/) (Vehicle acceleration in X (longitudinal acceleration).)
- [Vehicle.Acceleration.Vertical](vertical/) (Vehicle acceleration in Z (vertical acceleration).)

## About VSS

The [Vehicle Signal Specification](https://covesa.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/) (VSS)
is an initiative by COVESA to define a syntax and a catalog for vehicle signals.
The source code and releases can be found in the [VSS github repository](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification).

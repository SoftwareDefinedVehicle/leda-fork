## Signal Information




The vehicle signal `Vehicle.AngularVelocity` is a **Branch**.





## UUID

Each vehicle signal is identified by a [Universally Unique Identifier (UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier))

The UUID for `Vehicle.AngularVelocity` is `1eef530a43de56aab665d2766483cde2`

## Children

This vehicle signal is a branch or structure and thus has sub-pages:

- [Vehicle.AngularVelocity.Pitch](pitch/) (Vehicle rotation rate along Y (lateral).)
- [Vehicle.AngularVelocity.Roll](roll/) (Vehicle rotation rate along X (longitudinal).)
- [Vehicle.AngularVelocity.Yaw](yaw/) (Vehicle rotation rate along Z (vertical).)

## About VSS

The [Vehicle Signal Specification](https://covesa.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/) (VSS)
is an initiative by COVESA to define a syntax and a catalog for vehicle signals.
The source code and releases can be found in the [VSS github repository](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification).
